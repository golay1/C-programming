Assignment 6, Task 7

First value: 102
Second value: 37
Third value: 107

The first value is the dereference operator value of *ptr, 
and since *ptr points to arr[9], the value is 102. 
Notice the statement ( arr[*ptr] ++; ) increments the value at arr[102], 
which is outside the bounds of the array.

The second value is the dereferenced value of *x, which points to arr+4, 
which is 4 spots after the first index of the array, which is arr[4]=37.

The third value prints arr[4] + *ptr, which is arr[4] + 102. 
arr[4] was originally 37, but because *x points to the memory location of arr[4], 
and *x was changed to 5, that changes arr[4] to 5, and 5+102 is 107.
