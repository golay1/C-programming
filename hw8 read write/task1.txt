A global variable in C is declared outside function blocks and therefore has a wide scope.
It can be referenced by all functions after where it is declared.
It is in existence during the full execution time of the program.

Static variables in C exist the whole time the program is executing,
so when used in loops or recursion the static variable will not be reinitialized.
To create a static variable, write "static" before the declared variable.

Static variables have internal linkage so you can't use it in other source files (transation units) to refer to the same object.
Globa variables have external linkage if you declare it extern in another translation unit.
