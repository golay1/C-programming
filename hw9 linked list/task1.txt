Assignment 9 Task 1:

Differences between arrays and linked lists:

Arrays allow easy navigation and the use of row offsets, and they are easier to program.
However, you can't easily insert or delete items in an array, and you can't free memory after use if they're staitically allocated.

Linked lists can easily insert and delete new elements without moving other elements.
You also don't need to know the number of elements in advance and can release unneeded memory.
However, they are not easy to understand and manage, and it's not as easy to access a node in the middle.
